## Introduction
Author gave up medicine when he realised as a cancer specialist, that he was only delaying the inevitable and not curing them. But later he realised, that we can actually put a stop to the source, i.e., our lifestyle, which mostly is the cause for the diseases we get.

## Long game, from fast death to slow death
Longetivity is not just how long we live but also the quality with which we live. 

Most of the times when we are admitted to hospital itâ€™s too late and at the point where little could be done. The only good way is to change the source, the lifestyle. For example, the major reduction in people stopping smoking over last decade has eliminated so many problems.

Emotional health is also very important, as it alone as decimate whatever things we have been maintaining physically.
