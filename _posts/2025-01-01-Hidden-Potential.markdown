Been a while since i read this book but if i recollect correctly, It's about the fact that talent is not fixed/set by birth and that its actually in our control. We unlock our potential through growth, resilience and systemic change.

Some takeaways from the chapters:
1. Creatures of Discomfort: Fast growth happens when you embrace any discomfort faced while trying to learn things.
2. Human Sponges: Find the right habits and environment and always try to learn and improve.
3. The Imperfectionists: We cannot be perfect, we need to accept that mistakes can be made which would help me learn better.
4. Transforming the Daily Grind: Discipline is key. Try to transform the daily repetitive things or habits to something fun.
5. Getting unstuck: Progress is not linear. We may need to extra, like side projects, having mentors etc.
6. Defying gravity: Just resilience and grit is not enough, we need not start from scratch, taking support is ok - mentors, teachers, communities, etc.
7. Every child gets ahead: Schooling is designed in a way that, the kids who shine bright at start are given attention, but they need not be having long term potential. All kids need equal access, assessments should be redesigned to capture persistence, creativity, etc. Character skills are greater than raw scores we get in test, that is the curiosility, willingness and resilience to learn from feedback.
8. Mining for gold: We need to find those with hidden potential (gold) than always reward the obvious performers. Some examples were discussed on how people from varying places came together, filling blind spots and the diverse skills helped achieve their target. Good systems should support multiple ways to succeed as people grow in certain situations, or are late bloomers, etc. People should feel safe to ask questions etc, so that they voice their best thoughts and are not repressed.
9. Diamonds in the rough: Selection systems are flawed. Judge performance relative to opportunity.
