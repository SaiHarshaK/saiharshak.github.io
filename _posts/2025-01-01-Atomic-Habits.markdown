Been a while since i read this book but if i recollect correctly, start with small changes, to eventually make good things as habits and remove bad habits from your life.

- Try to not be goal-oriented but think about changing your self. Because once your goal is achieved you may not continue.
- Habit Loop: Cue -> Craving -> Response -> Reward
- Habit stacking is a nice approach to start new habits, where you attach a new habit right after something you already do.
- Even doing the new habit for 1 minute helps, basically the start matters.
- Remove Cues, for you to stop the bad habits. Easiest option. Like if we are addicted to video games, just delete them and its a pain to download and play again and we are not reminded often anymore.
- Joining a community of like minded people wanted to start a particular habit helps.
- Keep repeating, we will eventually get good, no need to be perfect from the start.
- Never miss a habit twice in a row.
