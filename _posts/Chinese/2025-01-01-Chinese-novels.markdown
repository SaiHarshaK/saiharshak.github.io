I love English-translated chinese novels, especially around Xianxia which is basically about protagonists/characters striving towards immortality through rigorious cultivation (training). What i like about this genre is about how, the protagonists are put into various difficult positions and to get out this hypothetical situation you would have to think out of the box with these imaginary constraints (like related to the novel world) which just amazes me. I also like how I can somehow imagine myself in some of these moments potrayed in the novels, them using various powers.

I was always a fan of Anime (Japanese animated shows) as a kid. But there were times where the shows were stuck at cliffhangers, which kinda forced me to look for more content and thereby i ended up with manga.
I'm not into black-and-white manga but coloured manga (for ex, Korean manga called Manhwa) probably because it's easier for me to imagine myself in it. And next similar to Manga, when it was stuck on cliffhangers, is when i came across lightnovels.

Why Chinese?  
It's because i love the world building they do and the super extensive lore they have about various types of mythical beasts for example, like dragons and pheonixes. Various references to Buddhas, Angels and Demons.
