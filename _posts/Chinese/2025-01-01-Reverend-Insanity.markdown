There was a phase where I started loving villain centric protagonists where they keep putting their own self-interest above others. Because the usual protagonist-making-sacrifices got me bored.

This novel is pretty dark where the protagonist will go to any length to pursue his sole goal - to be immortal. Everything else is just a stepping stone for him. In this fantasy world, it's been stuffed into the brains of the characters as a kid to always live for the clan, and sacrifice your interests and yourself for the clan. But the protagonist questions and breaks through all restrictions imposed on him or rather the society itself.

Again another thing I love here too is that fact that there are situations where he seems to be cornered with no way out, but according to the laws of the fantasy world, he comes up with some crazy out of the box solution to get out it, which give me the thrills.

What crazy is the fact that the novel got discontinued and actually banned in china because (according to some redit post) it was going against the values the chinese govt wanted to inculcate.

Just Imagine a Novel author being asked by the govt to stop writing, and then all the way getting it banned across the country - CRAZY.
