## Introduction 

The author gave up medicine when he realized as a cancer specialist that he was only delaying the inevitable rather than curing them. But later he realized that we can actually put a stop to the source, i.e., our lifestyle, which mostly is the cause of the diseases we get. 


## 1. Long game, from fast death to slow death 

Longevity is not just how long we live but also the quality with which we live.   
Most of the time, when we are admitted to hospital for a chronic disease, it’s too late and at the point where little could be done. The only good way is to change the source, the lifestyle. For example, the major reduction in people stopping smoking over the last decade has eliminated so many problems.  
Emotional health is also very important, as it alone can decimate whatever things we have been maintaining physically. 


## 2. Rethinking medicine for the age of chronic disease 

The author says resistance to change and innovation at his place for usual medical procedures, made him want to quit.  
It’s about the risk and reward factor, risk is more readily taken in other professions like banking finance but in Medicine, it's more emotional than analytical emphasis is put.  
There was an age old saying which got morphed to - Do no harm, which became the motto for surgeons. This doesn’t really make sense, coming from the old times, because they would follow more harmful procedures like bloodletting, drilling holes into skulls for headache, using mercury, which is super toxic, etc. 

It is not saying that we should look for riskiest but short-term harm might not mean long term harm.  
One example shared from author experience, was a patient who would have died in the elevator ride to operation room where the surgery could have been done in a sterile fashion. But there was a very high chance that he would have died if kept that long, so author had to operate him in the elevator itself, which did pose a huge risk but then again saved him. Sometimes doing nothing is the riskiest choice. 
Risk should be not straight up avoided but rather to be analyzed to work with.  

Most chronic diseases cure isn’t readily solvable like cancer, etc. and they are in the body for a long time before they trigger and is too late to be saved most of the times.  
Advancement to technology is also playing an important role in diagnosis and prevention of many diseases. Lot of gadgets which help patients to monitor their body health markers. Even when we go for tests, most are static which tell average data. For example, blood glucose is calculated when we fast and do tests to get an average value for the last 90 days. There are better ways now such as, use of devices which monitor blood glucose levels in real time, helping with much better diagnosis, taking a feedback driven approach.  
Most medicine procedures, diagnosis etc. right now are on data which is taking average on a huge set of people, and applying the medicine based on that. The new technological advances are helping view each patient as a unique individual and not just treating everybody as the same. 

We should start focusing on our quality of life (health span) for helping against diseases. Most medicine classes don’t really talk about things like how to maintain our physical and cognitive skills as we age, etc. - like exercise, having enough sleep, nutritional benefits. 

## 3. Objective, strategy, tactics 
Strategy is the overall plan while tactics is what we do to implement the smaller tasks at hand to achieve the result - the objective.  
Post age 50, we usually see deterioration in physical and cognitive skills. We should try to plan now itself if we want to tackle how we live in the later years. We can follow the activities of daily living, which has basic things like walking unassisted, bathing and grooming, preparing meals, etc. Pretty simple when we are young, but gets harder as we age in our later years.  
There is also emotional deterioration which can happen in young people too, something independent of age.

Med2.0 is the old medicine way where we treat the symptoms, but Med 3.0 preaches to change lifestyle, tackle the source. 

Med 3.0 primarily asks to do these to help with healthspan,
- Exercise 
- Nutrition 
- Emotional health 
- Sleep 
- Exogenous molecules (like hormones, Supplements) 

Exercise alone can help fight against so many ailments, especially cardiovascular exercises.  
Sleep is also very essential, it helps retain our cognitive skills much longer, fight against mental health issues 

## 4. Centenarians, the older we get the healthier we have been 
Lot of centenarians have peculiar habits like drinking, smoking and aren’t really that health conscious as an average person. It is very likely that the genes are in play for their longevity.  
What we can do is follow certain behaviors to get what the centenarians get for free via their genes, as getting their genes is out of picture.   
Natural selection prefers traits which help us reproduce early in life not those which help us stay healthy for long, this explains why most people still carry genes like male patterned baldness, etc. this concept is called antagonistic pleiotropy, where a gene may have beneficial effect early on (boosting fertility, bond strength, etc) but harmful effects later (cancer risk, neurodegeneration). Hence, the bad genes are carried forward as natural selection doesn’t care to eliminate them.  
So, to address these genes, we need to take extra measure by strengthening our cognitive skills, exercises, etc (the 5 things discussed in earlier chapters)  

We should focus on delaying the onset of diseases instead of delaying the duration of the disease.  
Another thing to note is that the research for tackling diseases are being done one at a time, that is separate research for cancer, for Alzheimer’s, for heart stroke, instead of finding the commonalities and trying to address those. 

## 5. Eat less live longer, science of hunger and health 

A molecule by the name Rapamycin, revolutionized the study of medicine, especially for transplant medicine. It was known to extend the maximum lifespan of people.  
It was initially used for its antifungal properties but was later discovered to have immunosuppressive (suppress immune system - organ transplant, new organs are not rejected by immune system) and anti-proliferative properties (stops cells from multiplying - cancer treatment).  
Researchers discovered that Rapamycin worked by inhibiting a protein complex inside cells that regulates growth and metabolism. This was named mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) after the drug itself. 

mTOR is present from yeast all the way to humans. As it is present in most life forms, it’s a very essential molecule according to evolution.   
When we have enough nutrients, mTOR is activated which is responsible for cell division and going into reproduction mode, while when nutrients are scarce, it’s inhibited thereby the cells go into cleanup mode, stopping cell divisions.  
It was the first molecule to increase longevity in mammals, and to give consistent results.   
There is correlation on less food intake to longevity too. But that was made when doing for smaller animals like rats and might not be relevant to complex being like humans.   
But in any case, if more nutrients were there the mitochondria would get oxidized over time or if not in use (being lazy I guess?) they would become less functional. When we do more exercise and have less nutrients than overdosing them, it helps in producing new mitochondria to replace them.   

In specific, less amino acids seems to shut down mTOR and hence start the cell cleanup process to destroy old proteins and old cells into proteins.  
But again, for a long time, given all these data points on rapamycin being a key driver to increasing longevity, we don’t use it on healthy people because of its immuno-suppressive effect. Then again, a derivative of rapamycin was found to have immuno-modulator effect - helps boost the vaccine effect. This suggested that rapamycin might not have immuno-suppressive but immuno-modulator.  

It was then noted that it showed immuno-suppressive effect when taking low doses at intermittent times, while it showed immune modulator effect when taking medium to high doses with rest periods in between.  
This is because there are actually two mTOR, mTOR1 and mTOR2. When taking daily both the molecules were inhibited but when taking it only briefly. Just mTOR1 was inhibited, which was seen to be the main molecule for longevity. Trials are happening around these findings currently. 

People are more skeptical about taking these medicines – why take Rapamycin when we are already healthy? as medicines are usually taken when sick. That’s why the author is trying to show why med 3.0 is important to bring the shift in mindset.  

## 6. The crisis of Abundance 

Liver is body true workhorse. A healthy liver is normally in a deep dark purple colour with smooth texture. It seems most people have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease where fat builds up in liver without alcohol consumption. 
Liver is also known to regenerate a lot, donor and recover of liver transplant both recover fairly quickly.  

Average is not necessarily optimal anymore. As the populace as a whole starts going overweight or showing symptoms of fatty liver, the average values of tests also skew over that direction. But those needn’t be optimal too. 

Obesity used to be a main symptom if it would develop towards one of the horsemen, but author talks about Metabolic dysfunction, to be the more proper term, where you don’t always have to be obese for falling under the bigger set of problems like cardiovascular disease etc. These 5 criteria help see if we have it, (if you have any 3 of these at least then you have it) 
1. High Blood Pressure 
2. High triglyceride (type of fat which is stored in body when having excess calories) 
3. Low HDL cholesterol (this is good cholesterol which helps transports fat from bloodstream into liver for disposal, having less means more chances of buildup in arteries etc) 
4. Abdominal Obesity (waist length) 
5. Elevated fasting glucose 

Metabolic health decides what happens to the calories we take, having metabolic syndrome means these nutrients go to places where they are not needed.  

Insulin – hormones decide what to do with incoming calories for storing energy. Broadly it ends up in either bloodstream for quick use of energy or stored as fat. Fat cells are important as they help store excess energy. If it’s all in bloodstream it’s basically like us having diabetes; high blood glucose is harmful for kidneys, blood vessels, nerves, eyes etc. And if fat cells are full then the excess calories have to go into bloodstream which is bad.  
Visceral fat or abdominal obesity on other hand is bad to have, as these fat cells are around the organs unlike subcutaneous fat cells in general which are spread throughout like arms, thoughts etc.  
Visceral fat cells release chemicals which increase insulin resistance.  

Once we have too much fat, it starts to spill into the muscles from around. Insulin resistant basically means that the cells (initially the muscle cells) stopped listening to the insulin signals. Imagine blowing a balloon, it gets harder to blow as it gets bigger. But there’s a limit to this, post which it just can’t hold any more air.  
Cortisol hormone, which is associated with stress and sleep, is a double-edged sword which removed subcutaneous fat but replaced it with more harmful visceral fat.  

Insulin-resistance also, is associated with cancer according to some studies.  
Fructose in large quantities also showed an increase in insulin, elevated blood pressure and fat gain. The same molecule is available in almost all fruits etc. It also produces a lot of uric acid when metabolizing, which has negative effects. Most mammals which eat a lot of fruits have an enzyme Uricase which helps clear out uric acid, but this isn’t present in humans.  
There were some studies on why we might have lost this enzyme, which attributed it to the evolution of humans. When apes were in Africa, there were abundant fruits to eat but when they migrated to Europe, where there was scarcity of food during winters, evolution went towards storing the extra energy in our cells. As a side effect they also lost the Uricase enzyme, Then these apes migrated back with their uricase silencing genes, and these eventually evolved into humans. Increased uric acid seems to increase lipogenesis (fat creation).   
This is useless in modern times as we have a lot of food abundance and preservative methods.   
But again, it’s very difficult to gain fat eating a lot of apples compared to table sugar because apple’s fructose is slowly digested with its fiber etc. Its not just fructose, but even a lot of preservatives give increased uric acid. So that’s why having a lot of fruit juice or foods with excessive preservatives are also bad.  

When cells metabolize, they spend some energy to metabolize and then after metabolizing the food they generate more ATPs. There is an enzyme which controls how much energy a cell can spend for metabolizing, but for fructose case another enzyme does it, which doesn’t put any limits. So, the body thinks that energy levels are dropping too much when metabolizing when in-fact a lot of energy is going to be generated.  
One test to check signs of early insulin resistance is, on empty stomach have a solution with high sugar (Doctors have this 75% sugar solution). If blood glucose levels remain elevated in the first hour, then insulin isn’t working at optimal rate. Ideally insulin should make sure it steadily goes into your cells.  

## 7. Confronting and preventing heart disease
Calcium test via CT scan on heart arteries checks for calcification in arteries. At an early age we should have 0, but many don’t; Even though on the outside they look perfectly normal. Because most people have non alarming or an average score (given average is shifted because population as a whole is getting unhealthy), doctors as per MED 2.0 tell us it’s all good. But infact, it’s a sign to take care of ourselves.

Cholesterol is important to our body, and used to produce cell membrane, hormones etc. All cells produce it, but liver produces the most and ships it to others and retrieves it. It is not water soluble, so it cannot be dissolved in our plasma to transport it everywhere else. Instead they are transported as tiny sphericals called lipo-proteins (The L in HDL and LDL - which are part lipids(fats) (inside the structure) and part proteins (outside the structure)).

They are called LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) because of the ratio of fat (lipid) to protein they contain. LDL carry more lipids while HDL carry less lipids, as lipids are of lower density. There are also VLDL (very low density Lipoprotein) which are even harmful. Basically, HDL outer later has protein Apolipoprotein-A, while LDL, VLDL and IDL(intermediate density) ones have Apolipoprotein-B which seems to be present in the calcification signature/Atherosclerosis. 

The cholesterol we eat such as from egg yolks etc, is just excreted and does little to contribute to Atherosclerosis. The vast majority of cholesterol in our body is actually produced by our own cells. Hence, we don’t really need to bother about over consumption of cholesterol food items. What is more problematic is the saturated fats consumed.  

The Artery walls are actually permeable (the tissue area) and the LDL, HDL molecules can pass through it - in and out. But the LDL molecules (specifically, Apo-B part of it) stick to it. So it’s not cholesterol which is bad but the particles carrying it. Eventually the particles which are stuck are oxidised. Same is the case with VLDL and IDL, or anything with Apo-B. If too much of the oxidised cells are present, monocytes (large white blood cells) come, and become macrophages and try to eat up the oxidized cells. But if it consumes too much cholesterol, it blows up into foam cells. All of these line up to form some clump of fatty cells.   

Here when HDLs comes across these foam cells, it would suck up the cholesterol using a process called delipidation. It also acts as an anti-oxidant for the artery cells. Though HDL helps us, increasing it via specialised drugs did not seem to give much benefit after some point, it’s more about increasing it’s functionality than the volume of it - for which research is currently going on.  
This is still an active area of research — understanding what exactly drives antioxidant protection or helps clear oxidized cells. Interestingly, some patients and centenarians have been found to have very high LDL levels yet show no signs of atherosclerosis. However, in most people, atherosclerosis and arterial plaque development are very hard to detect in the early stages.  
A CT angiogram (CTA) can help identify both calcified and non-calcified (soft) plaque, but it exposes you to more radiation than a regular CT scan. The author claims that in many cases, the information gained can justify the small added risk.

Over time, soft plaque becomes calcified, which is what shows up on a coronary calcium CT scan. However, the presence of calcified plaque also implies that there are likely other non-calcified (and potentially more dangerous) plaques that are not yet visible on the scan.  
The author also said that the calcified plaque is stable while the non calcified (soft) plaque can rupture, causing a clot and thereby a heart attack due to the block in the passage.  
The tests these days count number of Apo-B particles instead of LDL and HDL, as they are more meaningful, but most doctors still follow the old procedures.

Another deadly particle is the LP-a particle (Lipoprotein(a)), which is basically LDL with apolipoprotein(a). Due to the shape of it, it sweeps along any oxidised lipids along the way, so it kind of also helps clear out the passageway. But because it’s from the Apo-b family, it can also attach to the artery walls. And because of its structure it’s more likely to get stuck than LDL particles, along with the extra cargo of oxidised lipids, becoming more dangerous than LDL particles. More chances of causing plaques and ore mature heart attack.

We can only do limited things in reducing lpa(a) concentration but we can reduce Apo-B overall concentration, thereby reducing overall risk. But we can’t really lower them much with drugs without much side effects.
There were also studies done where they tried to reduce HDL-C and increase, both didn’t give much benefit.  

Smoking and blood pressure also damage the artery walls, thereby making it more easy for ApoB and other particles to get stuck

Saturated fat seems to increase synthesis of total cholesterol levels in body, and Apo-B particles. The excess saturated fat also seems to block the LDL receptors in liver thereby reducing the amount of LDL removed from circulation. 

## 8. Cancer
The median age of cancer diagnosis is 66. The older we get the more prevalent the chances of cancer become. The cure for cancer is still far away, what doctors can do is to try and delay remission. In some rare cases a person's immune system has fought and cured cancer.

Once a person gets cancer, there is a chance to get metastatic tumour (secondary tumour) - where the tumour cells move away from the primary site and start growing at other organs/tissues. This process is called metastasis. One example is breast cancer, metastasizing into the lungs.  
It is this that is responsible for most cancer deaths. Even after removing cancer from the primary tumour, we never know if it has already spread elsewhere and is just waiting to gain a foothold there - it won't turn up on any scans.
That's why people die when they get breast or prostate cancer while we do know that people can survive without these organs.

Cancer prevention is tricky as we don’t know the exact details yet unlike atherosclerosis and other diseases. Immunotherapy seems to show promise. Most importantly, it is crucial to find the cancer cells as early as possible, as it’s easier to deal with them at early stages.

People have tumour suppressor genes, such as PTEN, which regulate cell growth and prevent cells from forming tumours. In cancer patients, these genes are often found to be mutated or lost, which causes them to lose their normal function.  
Research shows that there is no - one or common set of genes causing cancer, but random set of mutations which come together to evolve into cancer. Two women having breast cancer can have two completely different cancer genomes and they would need different cure for their cases.

Chemotherapy affects those cells more, which rapidly divide - the cancer cells. But this is also true for non cancer cells like hair follicles, gut cells, mouth lining etc, and hence the most commonly seen side effects are on these sites. But on the other side, if the cancer cells survive these procedures they become even more resistant. 

Compared to normal cells, many cancer cells have altered metabolism, consuming huge amounts of glucose. They also have some uncanny ability to evade the immune system cells. If we were to solve these, we may get to target cancer cells only and sparing the non cancer cells, thereby the patient.

Coming to the metabolic part, most healthy cells use aerobic respiration which produces around 36-38 ATP cells but cancer cells use anaerobic respiration (don’t use O2) and give only 2 ATP cells. This is called the Warburg effect. We can use these findings to find cancer cell spots in the body, a radioactive high concentration of glucose is sent to the body and a pet scan shows where are the places with high glucose levels.  
But they do produce a lot of byproducts when doing anaerobic glycolysis which are used as building blocks for new cells. Another finding is that, the lactic acid etc produced as by products reduce the pH and the immune cells can’t function as good as normal. 

One key connection among obesity, smoking, and insulin resistance is that they all promote chronic inflammation, which in turn creates a biological environment that increases the risk for many chronic diseases, including cancer.

Elevated insulin levels can act as a cancer enabler, because insulin — along with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) — activates growth-promoting pathways (such as PI3K–AKT–mTOR). These pathways stimulate cell growth and proliferation while increasing glucose uptake by cells. When chronically elevated, this signaling can fuel tumor cells, which thrive on glucose and rapid growth.

There was a study about using drugs to reduce PI3K to tackle breast cancer. Only one person survived it, in that study, but one differentiating factor was that she strictly had low glucose diet. It was later noticed that, reducing PI3K would mean cell pathways to let glucose into cells was blocked, which meant more glucose staying behind in the bloodstream, which in turn meant more insulin production , which defeats the purpose - having low glucose diet like ketogenic diet, definitely helped. 

In Outlive, Peter Attia explains that T cells (T lymphocytes) are the immune system’s "assassins" designed to detect and destroy abnormal or cancerous cells. However, cancers often evade them by exploiting immune checkpoints that switch T cells off. The development of checkpoint inhibitor therapies—drugs that release these immune brakes—has allowed T cells to once again recognize and kill cancer cells, leading to remarkable cures in some cases.

As cancer grows there simply aren’t enough T cells to detect and kill them. Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT) - sometimes referred to as CAR-T cell therapy - where doctors take a patient's own T cells, modify or multiply them in a lab, and then re-infuse them into the body to hunt down and destroy cancer cells. These engineered T cells can be designed to recognize specific tumor markers that normal T cells might miss.  
These can be genetically modified or some isolated tumour cells can be taken and checked with body’s T cells if specifically any of them are able to kill them, and then those are multiplied and reinfused.

Our early stage cancer discovery systems are also not there yet. Lot of false positives and false negatives are present. With multiple tests, we get more clarity.
- **Sensitivity** measures how good a test is at detecting disease when it’s truly there — in other words, its ability to catch true positives. A highly sensitive test minimizes false negatives, meaning it’s unlikely to miss a case of cancer.
- **Specificity**, on the other hand, measures how good a test is at correctly identifying people who don’t have the disease. A highly specific test minimizes false positives, meaning it won’t mistakenly flag healthy people as having cancer.

## 9. Alzheimer's Disease
Apo-E correlates to Alzheimer’s, which is responsible for lipo transport and metabolism in brain. It gas three variants - E2, E3 and E4. 

Everyone inherits one copy from each parent, so you can be:
- E3/E3 (most common, “neutral” risk)
- E2/E3 or E2/E2 (slightly protective)
- E3/E4 or E4/E4 (higher Alzheimer’s risk)

These and other neuro-degenerative diseases don’t have any cure yet but we can try our best to prevent them:
- **Alzheimer’s**: Memory-loss dementia caused by buildup of amyloid and tau proteins that damage brain cells.
- **Lewy Body Dementia**: Dementia caused by alpha-synuclein (Lewy bodies); leads to hallucinations, alertness changes, and movement problems.
- **Parkinson’s Disease**: Movement disorder from loss of dopamine neurons; later can cause dementia due to Lewy body buildup. Also affected by alpha-synuclein.

There are E4/E4 centenarians too, who likely have other genes who protect them from Alzheimer’s. So just having E4 doesn’t guarantee a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.

The brain makes amyloid precursor protein (APP), which helps with neuron growth and repair. Normally, enzymes cut APP into harmless fragments. But when it’s cut the wrong way, it produces amyloid-beta, a sticky protein. These fragments clump together to form plaques between brain cells, disrupting communication and triggering inflammation. Over time, this leads to neuron death and Alzheimer’s disease.  
Tau helps stabilize the tiny structures (called microtubules) that transport nutrients and signals within brain cells.

Basically,  
Amyloid-beta builds up outside neurons (plaques).  
Tau tangles form inside neurons, causing inflammation and brain shrinkage.  
Together, they drive the brain damage seen in Alzheimer’s disease.  

![A-beta and Tau](assets/img/outlive_9.1.jpg)

Currently, this is the dominant theory right now and not conclusive that it by itself is the reason for Alzheimer’s. There were drugs developed to stop or reduce the Amyloid-beta production but the benefit is yet to be seen on the patients, but again these were tried on patients who were already on late stage - as they were identified later.  
There are many studies which question the correlation with Amyloid-beta and there are also lot of dementia patients with little to no build up of amyloid-beta; making it seem like it’s neither a sufficient or required condition for Alzheimer’s. 

Subtle brain changes begin long before the early, diagnosable stages of Alzheimer’s disease. These changes can occur years or even decades before memory loss becomes noticeable. Standard cognitive tests, such as recalling a list of words or repeating phrases, often fail to detect this early decline because they measure only obvious symptoms that appear later. By the time such tests show impairment, significant damage may already have occurred in the brain. 

Doing cognitive exercises clearly helped delay the Alzheimer’s process. Same is true with movement exercises for Parkinson’s disease. More complex the better, for example, dancing is better at delaying the progress than walking.

Some tests on rats show that restricting blood flow in brain, was also causing memory related issues and them being more severe in old ones. Even for us, as we age it’s possible for atherosclerosis to occur in the brain blood vessels. These studies also tried to show that amyloid-beta and the tangling is more of a product than the cause.

Having Diabetes increasing the chance of Alzheimer’s, as:  
With diabetes/insulin-resistance, your body’s ability to handle glucose is impaired, meaning higher circulating glucose, higher insulin, more variability, etc.
- This metabolic dysfunction damages blood vessels (including those in the brain) and leads to poorer perfusion (blood circulation).
- At the same time, neurons may struggle to use glucose effectively (or insulin signalling in the brain may be impaired) so their "fuel" supply is compromised (more on this below).
- The hippocampus and other brain areas critical for memory are especially vulnerable to metabolic dysfunction, so the damage accumulates.
- Genetic vulnerabilities (like APO-E E4) may worsen how metabolic dysfunction affects the brain.
- Over time, this combination facilitates the pathological changes seen in Alzheimer’s (neuron loss, dysfunction, accumulation of amyloid/​tau, etc).

Why are insulin receptors in brain if brain doesn’t store any energy?  
Insulin in fat or muscle says "store energy", but in the brain it says "maintain synapses, protect neurons, and coordinate metabolic signaling."

Studies also showed that E4 is poorer than the other variants in moving cholesterol in and out of the brain.  
Evolution wise the original ancestors have E4/E4 variants and were largely helpful against infectious diseases, the inflammation in brain helped fight these off but they are harmful in our modern life.

Exercise, especially endurance, helps the mitochondrial functionality and strength training. Specifically grip training seems to help Dementia cases. Apparently, sauna and maintaining oral health also helps.

## 10. Framework of Principles
Things we could do to tackle all the chronic diseases we have seen before:
- Exercises - aerobic and strength both
- Diet and nutrition
- Sleep
- Techniques and tools to improve emotional health
- drugs, supplements and hormones, basically the Exogenous molecules

## 11. Exercise
Both cardio and strength training are equally important. But compared to doing nothing, even walking is good.

One important biological marker is peak aerobic cardio respiratory fitness using VO2 - the max rate at which a person can utilize oxygen.

On the other hand, just big muscles aren’t enough, those muscles should be able to create force.

Exercise also helps with brain health - it releases molecules which improves memory, and also signals body for better bone and immune system.

Excelling at one sport is good, but lets say going all in on cycling only helps your lower body. Thats why the author emphasised that we should also be generic enough, and be able to do wide variety of things.
