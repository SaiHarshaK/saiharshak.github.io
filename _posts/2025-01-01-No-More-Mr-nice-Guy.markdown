Been a while since i read this book but if i recollect correctly, It's about the Nice Guy syndrome, where men try to gain approval and seek validations throughout their life, often at the cost of their happiness.

One things which I remember distinctly is when Author mentions how this shift in men has happened. Basically pre WW2, Men were autonomous and didn't really care about repurcussions.

Post WW2, because most men went into War and ended up losing their lives. The boys were raised by women, and there was no fatherly figure for them while growing up. Feminist extremists were the most vocal about things during this time, heavily influencing shame and _, while most women didn't really speak up. As for education, which is true even now, most teachers were and are women, and they heavily influence the boys' childhood. This resulted in men always seeking validations for their actions.

On another note, being a nice guy is actually not all that nice. You are sacrificing yourself and you assume that you are making other's better, but in fact you are not. What you are is, being manipulative and never true about yourself to your partner or family.

Author also says, the origin of the nice guy syndrome is deeply rooted to a person's childhood experiences.

Author also mentions that to heal, we should embrace honesty, hang out more in male groups to being closer to masculinity.
