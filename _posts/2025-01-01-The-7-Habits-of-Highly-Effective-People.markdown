Been a while since i read this book but if i recollect correctly, it's about a set of habits we should inculcate which would help us get better in any area of life - be it personal growth, relationships, or professional success.

The list of habits, I'll just write a bit about the ones not clear from title itself -  

HABIT 1: BE PROACTIVE.  
HABIT 2: BEGIN WITH THE END IN MIND.  
HABIT 3: PUT FIRST THINGS FIRST.  
- Prioritize items by importance and do it, focus on long term goals and NOT by urgency.  

HABIT 4: THINK WIN-WIN.  
- Synergy with others is the best way to achieve success.  

HABIT 5: SEEK FIRST TO UNDERSTAND, THEN TO BE UNDERSTOOD.  
HABIT 6: SYNERGIZE.  
- Teamwork and collaboration achieves far more than what individuals can do, by themselves.  

HABIT 7: SHARPEN THE SAW.  
- Keep improving yourself.
