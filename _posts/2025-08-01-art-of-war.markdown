I started reading The Art of War out of curiosity, since so many other authors reference it. The book feels more like a collection of guiding principles on how to approach and win wars—what factors give an edge, and what strategies tilt the balance.

That said, it isn’t an easy read. The translation sticks very close to the original, which preserves meaning but makes it harder to follow. After four chapters, I realized it requires a lot of focus to absorb properly, and for now, I’ve set it aside.
