Been a while since i read this book but if i recollect correctly, it's about the Japanese way of life, which is probably the reason for their long longetivity compared to other countries.

- Finding purpose
- Do things which let you go into the FLOW - where you are just immersed into activities and time just shoots through.
- Stay active, strong social ties, contributing to community (I guess this gives sense of purpose?)
- Plat based, low sugar and low calorie eating. Don't eat until you are full, but like 80%.
- Reconnect with Nature, Live your current moment.
- Don't take too much stress
