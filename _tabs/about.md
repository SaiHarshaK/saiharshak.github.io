# Hi there! I'm Harsha üëã

I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft India with 4 years of experience building solutions with **C#**, **C++**, and leveraging **AI tools** to enhance productivity and efficiency. My passion lies in exploring how artificial intelligence can transform the way we work and solve problems.

## What You'll Find Here üìö

This blog is my digital space to share insights and discoveries from two main areas of my life:

### üìñ Books & Personal Growth
I'm an avid reader of self-help and personal development books. Some that have significantly impacted my thinking include:
- **Ikigai** - Finding purpose and meaning in life
- **The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People** - Timeless principles for personal and professional effectiveness
- **Atomic Habits** - The power of small changes that compound over time

I'm always on the lookout for new books that can offer fresh perspectives on productivity, mindset, and personal growth. When I'm not reading self-help books, you'll often find me diving into Xianxia light novels for some entertaining escapism.

### üíª Technology & Programming
With my professional experience at Microsoft, I share practical insights about:
- Software development with C# and C++
- AI tools and how they're revolutionizing developer productivity
- Programming discoveries and best practices I encounter in my daily work
- Thoughts on the evolving tech landscape

## Why This Blog? ü§î

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences. This blog serves as both a personal learning journal and a way to give back to the community. Whether you're a fellow developer looking to leverage AI in your workflow, someone interested in personal development, or just curious about my journey, I hope you find something valuable here.

## Let's Connect! üåê

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss books, technology, or anything else that sparks your curiosity. I'm always open to interesting conversations and learning from others' experiences.
